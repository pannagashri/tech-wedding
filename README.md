Wedding invite

Hi everyone!
Sagar & Pannaga here.
This is a small wedding invite that we have created. To run this invite, you need to  clone the git folder and run the script "wedding_card.sh" on your shell terminal. 
Please note that this is a <b>bash script</b> and you should have a Linux terminal to run it on.

To clone this repository,
   <p>#git clone https://github.com/pannagashri/tech-wedding.git</p>

This should create a local repository called "tech-wedding"
Change the current working directory to the local repository
To do this,
   <p>#cd tech-wedding</p>

Now just run the following command:
   <p>#sh wedding_card.sh</p>
